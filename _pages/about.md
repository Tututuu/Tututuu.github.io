<span style="color:#0749a3; font-size: 35px;"><b>Welcome!</b></span>

I'm Hanyao, a fifth-year PhD student in economics at <span style="color:#0749a3;">Columbia University</span>, where I have the privilege of being advised by Professor <a href='https://www.columbia.edu/~md3405/'>Mark Dean</a>. I received my BA from <span style='color:#B10000'> Peking University</span> in 2020. You can find my CV <a href="../cv">here</a>.


I mainly work on behavioral economics, where I employ experimental methods to test theories of human decision making, especially under uncertainty.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>

    This paper introduces a novel experimental design tracking subjects’ calculations
    when valuing lotteries with a calculator. Subjects predominantly employ simple functional forms, primarily expected values or linear functions of monetary outcomes. The
    calculations exhibit remarkable within-subject stability alongside substantial between-subject heterogeneity. Calculations strongly predict risk attitudes: subjects calculating
    expected values exhibit near risk-neutrality, while others display extreme unresponsiveness to probability changes and are consistent with Tversky and Kahneman's (1992)
    fourfold pattern. Notably, these calculations also predict subjects’ valuations of deterministic mirrors (Oprea, 2024), as well as the lottery valuations when not provided with
    a calculator. Leveraging the calculation data, I examine the mechanisms behind the
    observed fourfold pattern and unresponsiveness by: (1) distinguishing implementation
    costs from misconceptions, finding evidence suggesting each is linked to different subject
    types, and (2) evaluating probability weighting and cognitive imprecision models against
    observed calculations.
