<span style="color:#0749a3; font-size: 35px;"><b>Welcome!</b></span>

I'm Hanyao, a sixth-year PhD student in economics at <span style="color:#0749a3;">Columbia University</span>, where I have the privilege of being advised by Professors <a href='https://www.columbia.edu/~md3405/'>Mark Dean</a>, <a href='https://blogs.cuit.columbia.edu/ac186/'> Alessandra Casella</a>, and <a href='https://blogs.cuit.columbia.edu/mw2230/'>Michael Woodford</a>. I received my BA from <span style='color:#B10000'> Peking University</span> in 2020. 

<span style='color:red'> I will be on the job market for the 2025-26 cycle. <span>

I mainly work on behavioral economics, where I employ experimental and econometric methods to test theories of human decision making, especially under uncertainty.

You can find my CV <a href="../cv">here</a>.

## Job Market Paper

    _Abstract_: I introduce a novel experimental design tracking subjects' calculations when valuing lotteries. Subjects' calculations predominantly fall into three groups: expected values, linear functions of potential monetary outcomes, or expressions that cannot be matched to primitives of the lotteries. Across different tasks, the calculations exhibit remarkable within-subject stability alongside substantial between-subject heterogeneity. Calculations strongly predict valuations: subjects performing calculations related to the expected values (38.1%) exhibit near risk-neutrality, while others' (61.9%) valuations on average display extreme unresponsiveness to probability changes. Finally, an analysis by calculation group reveals that distinct theoretical mechanisms drive these behaviors: the adoption of expected-value calculations is explained by a reduction in implementation costs from the provided calculator, while attribute substitution (Kahneman and Frederick, 2002) explains the linear functions of potential monetary outcomes.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
    We develop a novel two-step procedure to correct for the mistakes in experimental subjects’ responses to lottery valuation tasks. In the first step, we estimate the structure of mistakes when subjects value the deterministic mirrors of the lotteries (Oprea, 2024) – a deterministic payment that is disaggregated to resemble lotteries – by estimating a mixture model that incorporates two types of mistakes frequently identified in the data. In the second step, we utilize the mistake structure when valuing the deterministic mirrors to correct for the lottery valuations. The corrected lottery valuations are closer to risk neutrality than the raw valuations. When the corrected lottery valuations deviate from risk neutrality, they are predominantly risk averse. Finally, we apply the same two-step procedure to other data sets and yield similar results.
