<span style="color:#0749a3; font-size: 35px;"><b>Welcome!</b></span>

I'm Hanyao, a sixth-year PhD student in economics at <span style="color:#0749a3;">Columbia University</span>, where I have the privilege of being advised by Professor <a href='https://www.columbia.edu/~md3405/'>Mark Dean</a>. I received my BA from <span style='color:#B10000'> Peking University</span> in 2020. You can find my CV <a href="../cv">here</a>.

<span style='color:red'> I will be on the job market for the 2024-25 cycle. <span>

I mainly work on behavioral economics, where I employ experimental methods to test theories of human decision making, especially under uncertainty.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
    I introduce a novel experimental design tracking subjects' calculations when valuing lotteries. Subjects' calculations predominantly fall into three groups: expected values, linear functions of potential monetary outcomes, or expressions that cannot be matched to primitives of the lotteries. Across different tasks, the calculations exhibit remarkable within-subject stability alongside substantial between-subject heterogeneity. Calculations strongly predict valuations: subjects performing calculations related to the expected values (38.1%) exhibit near risk-neutrality, while others' (61.9%) valuations on average display extreme unresponsiveness to probability changes. Finally, an analysis by calculation group reveals that distinct theoretical mechanisms drive these behaviors: the adoption of expected-value calculations is explained by a reduction in implementation costs from the provided calculator, while attribute substitution (Kahneman and Frederick, 2002) explains the linear functions of potential monetary outcomes.
