<span style="color:#0749a3; font-size: 35px;"><b>Welcome!</b></span>

I'm Hanyao, a PhD student in economics at <span style="color:#0749a3;">Columbia University</span>, where I have the privilege of being advised by Professors <a href='https://www.columbia.edu/~md3405/'>Mark Dean</a>, <a href='https://blogs.cuit.columbia.edu/ac186/'> Alessandra Casella</a>, and <a href='https://blogs.cuit.columbia.edu/mw2230/'>Michael Woodford</a>. I received my BA from <span style='color:#B10000'> Peking University</span> in 2020. 

I mainly work on behavioral economics, where I employ experimental and econometric methods to test theories of human decision making, especially under uncertainty.

You can find my CV <a href="../cv">here</a>.

    _Abstract_: I introduce a novel experimental design tracking experimental subjects' calculations when valuing lotteries. The calculations predominantly fall into three groups: expected values, linear functions of monetary outcomes, or those unmatched to lottery primitives. Calculations exhibit remarkable within-subject stability alongside substantial between-subject heterogeneity. Calculations strongly predict valuations: subjects performing expected values-related calculations display near risk-neutrality, while on average, other subjects' valuations display extreme unresponsiveness to changes in probabilities. An analysis by calculation group reveals distinct behavioral mechanisms driving behaviors: adoption of expected-value calculations is consistent with the reductions in implementation costs from the provided calculator, while the linear functions of monetary outcomes are consistent with the theory of attribute substitution(Kahneman and Frederick, 2002).

  <details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Risk preferences recovered from lottery valuation data are not robust to unverifiable assumptions about the structure of mistakes in the valuations. To address this, we develop a novel approach utilizing Oprea's (2024) deterministic mirrors -- deterministic payments that preserve key structural features of lotteries. We estimate the mistake structure in deterministic mirrors -- where certain payments enable identification of mistake patterns -- through a mixture model incorporating two types of mistakes frequently observed, then apply these estimates to correct lottery valuations. The corrected valuations are closer to risk neutrality than raw valuations; when they deviate from risk neutrality, they are predominantly risk averse. These patterns align the corrected valuations with expected utility theory, in contrast to the raw valuations which exhibit strong probability weighting. Our approach offers a generalizable framework for preference recovery: researchers can use auxiliary tasks with known correct answers to discipline assumptions about mistakes.

- Reference-Dependent Motivated Beliefs, with <a href='https://zhihao-lim.github.io/' target='_blank'>Zhi Hao Lim</a>

  <summary>Summary</summary>
    People face a trade-off when they engage in motivated reasoning about a welfare-relevant state that realizes in the future. For example, by manipulating their beliefs to be higher than the Bayesian belief, on the one hand, their current-period anticipatory utility increases. But, on the other hand, since their current-period belief becomes their reference point when the state actually realizes, this motivated reasoning will also lead to lower next-period reference-dependent utility. A model incorporating this trade-off can predict the direction and strength of motivated beliefs. We design an experiment to test the model predictions.
